//In this assignment, we will find the smallest positive integer that 
// can be expressed as a sum of two positive cube numbers in two distinct ways.
// More specifically, we want to find the smallest n such that n == i1*i1*i1 + j1*j1*j1, 
// n == i2*i2*i2 + j2*j2*j2, and (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) are not the same in the sense that
// not only (i1, j1) not euqal to (i2, j2), but also (i1, j1) not equal to (j2, i2).
// We practice using loops in this assignment.
// Also, we practice how to do an early exit in a loop. We exit the loop once we find the smallest n. 
// Once we are done, we will be delighted surprised to find out that this number already played a big role in 
// our computer science study.
